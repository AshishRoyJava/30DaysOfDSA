# 30 days challenge practicing Data Structure and Algorithms

This is a repository that contains most important programs on Data Structure and 
Algorithms that everyone should know. I have taken this challenge practicing
around 5 to 6 problems and update the solutions in this repository.

The problems are solved in Java.

## Following is the list of problems:
The problems are packaged day wise inside the Java project as well.

### Day 1 : (Arrays)
1. Find the duplicate in an array of N integers. 
2. Sort an array of 0’s 1’s 2’s without using extra space or sorting algorithm 
3. Repeat and Missing Number 
4. Merge two sorted Arrays without extra space 
5. Kadane’s Algorithm 
6. Merge Overlapping Sub-intervals 

### Day 2: (Arrays)
7. Set Matrix Zeros 
8. Pascal Triangle 
9. Next Permutation 
10. Inversion of Array (Using Merge Sort) 
11. Stock Buy and Sell 
12. Rotate Matrix 

### Day 3: (Maths)
13. Excel Column Number
14. Find x^n in logn time
15. Count Trailing zeroes in factorial of a number
16. Find GCD of a number
17. Find number of unique paths in a grid.
